RFC #252                                        Bolt Beranek and Newman
NIC #7693                                       8 October 1971
Categories: F, G.3
Updates:  RFC 240
Obsoletes: None


     The purpose of this RFC is to report on the recent status of most
Network Hosts.  During September 27 through September 29 the BBN prototype
Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) was in-accessible due to hardware
debugging.  The Network was, therefore, not examined on these days.

     Three Hosts which were not officially able to act as Server's at the
time of RFC #240 are now able to do so.  These Hosts are:

NETWORK
ADDRESS         SITE                    COMPUTER
-------         ----                    --------

  2             SRI (NIC)               PDP-10
  6             MIT (Multics)           H-645
  9             HARVARD                 PDP-10

     The Harvard PDP-10, however, has limited core space.  They will,
therefore, run the Telnet program only occasionally.

     The following two tables summarize the information on the Host status
for September 30 - October 8.

where

D = Dead. (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network
    partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP).

R = Refused. (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

T = Timed out. (Destination Host did not respond in any way to the initial
    RFC, although not dead.)

H = 1/2 Open.  (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
    immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

O = Open. (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)

*  The UCLA IBM-360/91 currently has Remote Job Service (NETRJS), but has
   not implemented a full server Telnet System.  The BBN Terminal IMP is
   not equipped to test NETRJS;  however, we are assuming that receipt of
   the UCLA explanatory message indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.

#  These sites advertise that they may not have their system available at
   these time.
